# 🕵️‍♂️ cipherself

**cipherself** is a simple CLI tool that shows you what the public internet knows about you. It scans your GitHub activity and public search records to generate a "declassified" intelligence report about your digital footprint.

## 🔍 What this does

Simply put, **cipherself** takes a GitHub username and a real name, then searches the public web to answer:
- **How do you code?** (Languages used, peak activity hours, account age).
- **What is your public presence?** (Snippets from Google and DuckDuckGo).
- **Social Intelligence?** (Public Reddit activity, karma, and community engagement — **no API keys required**).
- **What can be inferred about you?** (Heuristic analysis of your personality and work style).
- **What is your data worth?** (Estimates of your market value to ad platforms).

All findings are compiled into a styled **PDF Dossier** that looks like a leaked intelligence document.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Public Data Only**: This tool does not access private accounts, deleted data, or password-protected content.
- **Search Scraping**: Web search results depend on public accessibility. Google and DuckDuckGo may occasionally rate-limit requests.
- **Heuristic Inferences**: Personality and work-style inferences are based on common patterns (e.g., "commits at 2 AM = nocturnal") and are intended for research, not definitive profiling.
